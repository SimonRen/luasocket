This directory contains some sample programs using LuaSocket as well as
the automatic tests used to make sure the library is working properly.

The files provided are:

	server.lua				-- test server
	client.lua				-- test client
	command.lua				-- test command definitions
	listen.lua				-- echo server
	talk.lua				-- echo tester
	smtp.lua				-- SMTP client protocol sample library
	http.lua				-- HTTP client protocol sample library

The automatic tests are composed by three files: client.lua, command.lua
and server.lua. To run the automatic tests on your system, make sure to
compile the library with _DEBUG defined (check makefile) and then open two
terminals.  Run 'luasocket server.lua' on one of them and 'luasocket
client.lua' on the other. The programs should start talking to each other.

listen.lua and talk.lua are about the simplest applications you can write
using LuaSocket. Run 'luasocket listen.lua' and 'luasocket talk.lua' on
different terminals. Whatever you type on talk.lua will be printed by
listen.lua.

http.lua and smtp.lua are libraries implementing part of HTTP and SMTP
client protocols. You are free to modify them and use them. Please send any
corrections and comments diego@tecgraf.puc-rio.br.

Good luck,
Diego.
