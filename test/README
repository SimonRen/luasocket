This provides the  automated test scripts used to make  sure the library
is working properly.

The files provided are:

    testsrvr.lua            -- test server
    testclnt.lua            -- test client
    testcmd.lua             -- test command definitions

To run  the automatic  tests on  your system, make  sure to  compile the
library  with  _DEBUG  defined  (check   makefile)  and  then  open  two
terminals. Run  'luasocket testsrvr.lua' on  one of them  and 'luasocket
testclnt.lua' on  the other. The  programs should start talking  to each
other and report any failure. The tests can also be used as a benchmark.

    urltest.lua             -- url.lua test module
    codetest.lua            -- code.lua test module
    concattest.lua          -- concat.lua test module

To run these tests, just run luasocket on them and see the results.

Good luck,
Diego.
