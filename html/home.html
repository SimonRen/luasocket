<h2><a name=down>Download</a></h2><p>

The library can be downloaded in source code from the following links: <p>

<a href="luasocket-1.4.tar.gz">luasocket-1.4.tar.gz</a> <br>
<a href="luasocket-1.4.zip">luasocket-1.4.zip</a> <p>

Besides the full C and Lua source code for the library, the distribution
contains several examples, this user's manual and the test procedures.

I  am also  providing  a Windows  binary  for those  that  want to  give
LuaSocket a quick try: <p>

<a href="luasocket-1.4.exe">luasocket-1.4.exe</a> <p>

This  binary has  been  compiled with  the  <tt>_DEBUG</tt> option,  and
should be able to run the automatic testing procedures. <p>

<h2><a name=whatis>What is LuaSocket?</a></h2><p>

LuaSocket  is a  <a href="http://www.lua.org">Lua</a>  extension library
that provides  support for the TCP  and UDP transport layers  within the
Lua language.  Network support has been  implemented so that it  is both
efficient and simple to use. <p>

LuaSocket can be used by any  Lua application desiring access to network
communication on the Internet, once it has been properly linked with and
initialized by the interpreter running the Lua application. The code has
been tested and runs well on several Windows and Unix platforms.<p>

The library also provides extra Lua modules implementing support for the
SMTP  (sending  e-mails),  HTTP  (www access)  and  FTP  (uploading  and
downloading files) protocols. <p>

The library is available under the same  
<a href="http://www.lua.org/copyright.html">
terms and conditions</a> as the Lua language, that  is, it  can be  used 
at  no cost  for both  academic and commercial purposes. <p>

<h3><a name=old>Old Versions</a></h3><p>

All  previous versions  of the  LuaSocket library  can be  downloaded 
<a href="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/luasocket/old">here</a>. Although
these  versions are  no longer  supported, they  are still available for
those that have compatibility issues. <p>

<h3><a name=current>Current Version</a></h3><p>

LuaSocket version  1.4 is now  available for download! It  is compatible
with   Lua&nbsp;4.0   and   has    been   tested   on   Windows&nbsp;98,
Windows&nbsp;2000, Linux, AIX, SunOS and IRIX. <p>

<h3><a name=new>What's New</a></h3><p>

Most of  the changes for  1.4 have been made  on the Lua  modules, which
have been almost completely rewritten.  There have been some API changes
that made  the interface simpler and  more consistent. Here are  some of
the changes that made it into version 1.4:

<ul>
<li> Bug-fix: <tt>lua_socketlibopen</tt> was  leaving the tags structure
     in Lua's stack;
<li> Bug-fix:  <tt>select</tt> was not  detecting a timeout  when called
     with zero as the timeout limit;
<li> Lua-4.1-alpha friendly, although not yet thread-safe. Will wait until 
     4.1 is released;
<li> New parameter  passing philosophy using named  parameters in tables
     made the interface much simpler (although breaking compatibility);
<li> All modules follow 
     <a href="http://www.lua.org/notes/ltn007.html">LTN  7</a> 
     (Modules &amp; Packages) to avoid name space collisions (although
     breaking compatibility);
<li> Better automatic test procedures for all modules;
<li> New  URL module, for URL  parsing, relative URL resolution  and URL
     escaping;
<li> base64.lua has been upgraded and made into the new Code module,
     responsible for content coding translations;
<li> Modules are more RFC pedantic;
<li> <tt>lua_socketlibopen</tt>  now returns  an error  if it  failed to
     initialize WinSock;
<li> There are no ilegitimate global variable accesses, that is, all
     variable references are local unless they need to be global;
<li> More sample code.
</ul>

<h3><a name=incompat>Incompatibilities with previous versions</a></h3><p>

TCP and UDP code should keep working  without change. HTTP, FTP and SMTP
code should be modified to use the new improved API. <p>
