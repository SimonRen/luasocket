This directory contains some sample  programs using LuaSocket as well as
the automatic tests used to make sure the library is working properly.

The files provided are:

	server.lua				-- test server
	client.lua				-- test client
	command.lua				-- test command definitions

The automatic tests are composed by three files: client.lua, command.lua
and server.lua. To run the automatic tests  on your system, make sure to
compile the library  with _DEBUG defined (check makefile)  and then open
two terminals. Run 'luasocket server.lua'  on one of them and 'luasocket
client.lua'  on the  other. The  programs should  start talking  to each
other.

	listen.lua				-- echo server
	talk.lua				-- echo tester

listen.lua  and talk.lua  are about  the simplest  applications you  can
write  using  LuaSocket.  Run   'luasocket  listen.lua'  and  'luasocket
talk.lua' on different terminals. Whatever  you type on talk.lua will be
printed by listen.lua.

	dict.lua				-- dict client

The  dict.lua module  is a  cool simple  client for  the DICT  protocol,
written by Luiz  Henrique Figueiredo. Just run it and  enter a few words
to see it working.

Good luck,
Diego.
