This directory contains some sample  programs using LuaSocket. This code
is not supported.

    listener.lua            -- socket to stdout
    talker.lua              -- stdin to socket

listener.lua and talker.lua are about  the simplest applications you can
write  using  LuaSocket.  Run   'luasocket  listen.lua'  and  'luasocket
talk.lua' on different terminals. Whatever  you type on talk.lua will be
printed by listen.lua.

    dict.lua                -- dict client

The  dict.lua module  is a  cool simple  client for  the DICT  protocol,
written by Luiz  Henrique Figueiredo. Just run it and  enter a few words
to see it working.

    daytimeclnt.lua         -- day time client

Just run the program to retrieve the hour and date in readable form from
any server running an UDP daytime daemon.

    echoclnt.lua            -- UDP echo client
    echosrvr.lua            -- UDP echo server

These are a UDP echo client/server pair. They work with other client and
servers as well.

    tftpclnt.lua            -- Trivial FTP client

This module implements file retrieval by the TFTP protocol. Its main use
is to test the UDP code, but someone might find it usefull.

    broadcast.lua           -- Broadcast telnet server

This is a simple server that waits simultaneously on two server sockets for
telnet connections. Everything it receives from the telnet clients is
broadcast to every other connected client. It tests the select function and
shows how to create a simple server whith LuaSocket. Just run broadcast.lua
and then open as many telnet connections as you want to ports 8080 and
8081.

Good luck,
Diego.
