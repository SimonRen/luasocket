This directory contains some sample  programs using LuaSocket. This code
is not supported.

    listener.lua            -- socket to stdout
    talker.lua              -- stdin to socket

listener.lua and talker.lua are about  the simplest applications you can
write  using  LuaSocket.  Run   

	'lua -l luasocket listen.lua'  and  'lua -l luasocket talk.lua'

on different terminals. Whatever  you type on talk.lua will be
printed by listen.lua.

    dict.lua                -- dict client

The dict.lua  module was  a cool  simple client  for the  DICT protocol,
written by Luiz Henrique Figueiredo. This new version has been converted
into a library, similar to the HTTP  and FTP libraries, that can be used
from within  any luasocket application. Take  a look on the  source code
and you will be able to figure out how to use it.

    daytimeclnt.lua         -- day time client

Just run the program to retrieve the hour and date in readable form from
any server running an UDP daytime daemon.

    echoclnt.lua            -- UDP echo client
    echosrvr.lua            -- UDP echo server

These are a UDP echo client/server pair. They work with other client and
servers as well.

    tinyirc.lua             -- irc like broadcast server

This is a simple server that  waits simultaneously on two server sockets
for telnet connections.  Everything it receives from  the telnet clients
is  broadcasted to  every other  connected client.  It tests  the select
function and shows  how to create a simple server  whith LuaSocket. Just
run tinyirc.lua and  then open as many telnet connections  as you want
to ports 8080 and 8081.

Good luck,
Diego.
